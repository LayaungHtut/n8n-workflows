# Credentials Folder

⚠️ Do NOT store any real credentials in this folder.

n8n stores credentials internally inside its database.  
This folder exists only for documentation purposes.

If you want, you may place:
- placeholder example credential files (without real values)
- notes about how to configure credentials in n8n

But NEVER put real API keys, OAuth tokens, client secrets, Telegram bot tokens, etc.
